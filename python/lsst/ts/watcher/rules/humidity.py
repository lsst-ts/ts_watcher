    The alarm name is f"Humidity.{name}".

    Like most rules based on data from the ESS CSC: this uses
    `FilteredTopicField` and its ilk, because a given topic may be output
    for more than one sensor (e.g. there may be two humidity sensors
    or two 4-channel temperature sensors connected to the same CSC)
    where the data is differentiated by the value of the sensorName field.
