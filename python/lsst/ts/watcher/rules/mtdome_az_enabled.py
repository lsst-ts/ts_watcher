        Parameters
        ----------
        data : `salobj.BaseMsgType`
              Message from the topic described by topic_callback.
        **kwargs : `dict` [`str`, `typing.Any`]
            Keyword arguments. If triggered by `TopicCallback` calling
            `update_alarm_severity`, the arguments will be as follows:

            * topic_callback : `TopicCallback`
              Topic callback wrapper.

        Returns
        -------
        None, if no change or unknown, or a tuple of two values:

        severity: `lsst.ts.xml.enums.Watcher.AlarmSeverity`
            The new alarm severity.
        reason : `str`
            Detailed reason for the severity, e.g. a string describing
            what value is out of range, and what the range is.
            If ``severity`` is ``NONE`` then this value is ignored (but still
            required) and the old reason is retained until the alarm is reset
            to ``nominal`` state.

        Notes
        -----
        You may return `NoneNoReason` if the alarm state is ``NONE``.
