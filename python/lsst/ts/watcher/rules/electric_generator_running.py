        reason : `str`
            Detailed reason for the severity, e.g. a string describing
            what value is out of range, and what the range is.
            If ``severity`` is ``NONE`` then this value is ignored (but still
            required) and the old reason is retained until the alarm is reset
            to ``nominal`` state.

        Notes
        -----
        You may return `NoneNoReason` if the alarm state is ``NONE``.
