class MockPagerDuty:
    """A mock PagerDuty service to support Watcher escalation in unit tests.

    Parameters
    ----------
    port : `int`
        The TCP/IP port for the service. 0 to choose a free port.
        The default is 80 because that is what PagerDuty uses.

    Notes
    -----
    To use::

        async with MockPagerDuty(port=...) as server:
            # ... use the server

        # Or if you prefer explicit start/stop:

        server = MockPagerDuty(port=...)
        await server.start()
        # ... use the server
        await server.close()

    Known limitations:

    * At present this only supports event creation.
      We would probably want need add support for close and/or delete
      if we decide to use PagerDuty for the Watcher.
    * The events dict is never purged (though it would be if we add
      delete support). This is an explicit memory leak.

    Raises
    ------
    `RuntimeError`
        If env var ``ESCALATION_KEY`` not set.

    Attributes
    ----------
    port : `int`
        The port. The port argument, except if that was 0 then this is
        updated to the chosen port when `start` is run.
    url : `str`
        The root URL of the service. "" until `start` has run.
    escalation_key : `str`
        The value of env var ESCALATION_KEY.
    events : `dict` [`str`, `dict`]
        Dict of event ID: event data in PagerDuty's format.
        See ALLOWED_KEYS for the allowed keys; all values are str
        except "payload", which is a dict of [str, str].
        "payload" has the information about what went wrong;
        its keys are described in ALLOWED_PAYLOAD_KEYS.
    reject_next_request : `bool`
        If the user sets this true then the mock will reject the next request
        with `web.HTTPInternalServerError` and reset this flag. For unit tests.
