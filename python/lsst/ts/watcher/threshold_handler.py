class ThresholdHandler:

    Parameters
    ----------
    warning_level : `float` | `None`
        Warning level. None to not use this level.
    serious_level : `float` | `None`
        Serious level. None to not use this level.
    critical_level : `float` | `None`
        Critical level. None to not use this level.
    hysteresis : `float`
        The amount by which the measurement must decrease below
        (or increase above if ``big_is_bad`` false) a severity level,
        before alarm severity is decreased.
    big_is_bad : `bool`
        True if measured values larger than the specified levels are bad;
        examples include most humidity, temperature, and vacuum measurements.
        False if measured values smaller than the levels are bad;
        the classic example is dew point depression.
    value_name : `str`
        Name of the value, e.g. "humidity" or "dew point depression".
    units : `str`
        Units of measurement.
    value_format : `str`, optional
        Format for float value (threshold level or measured value)
        without a leading colon, e.g. "0.2f"
    warning_msg : `str`, optional
        The first part of the reason string for a warning alarm.
        This should say what the operators should do.
    serious_msg : `str`, optional
        The first part of the reason string for a serious alarm.
        This should say what the operators should do.
    critical_msg : `str`, optional
        The first part of the reason string for a critical alarm.
        This should say what the operators should do.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError

        * The non-None levels are not strictly ordered,
          or are separated by less than ``hysteresis`` * 1.1.
        * hysteresis or any non-None level is not finite.
